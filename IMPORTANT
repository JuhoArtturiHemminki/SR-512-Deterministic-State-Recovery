INTEGRATION NOTICE: MANDATORY FULL-STACK ARCHITECTURE
THIS PROTOCOL STACK (SR-512, GS-512, AND G-STORM-512) IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY AS A UNIFIED WHOLE. EACH OF THESE THREE MAIN MODULES IS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE OTHERS, AND THEY MUST NOT BE USED SEPARATELY OR DETACHED FROM ONE ANOTHER. SIMILARLY, THE INTERNAL TR (TEMPORAL RESONANCE) AND HR (HYPER-RESONANCE) COMPONENTS MUST NOT BE SEPARATED OR REMOVED FROM THE CHAIN.

    INSEPARABLE TRINITY: SR-512, GS-512, AND G-STORM-512 CONSTITUTE A SINGLE UNBROKEN CHAIN. THE DETERMINISTIC SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM RELIES ON ALL THREE MODULES BEING PRESENT AND OPERATING SEQUENTIALLY.
    INTEGRITY OF TR AND HR COMPONENTS: THE TR AND HR MODULES ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS ARCHITECTURE. THEY MUST NOT BE DETACHED, AND THE DATA ANALYSIS FLOW BETWEEN THEM MUST NOT BE BROKEN, AS THEY PROVIDE THE ACTIVE PROTECTION LAYER FOR THE ENTIRE SYSTEM.
    NO PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION: THIS IS NOT A MODULAR LIBRARY FROM WHICH INDIVIDUAL PARTS CAN BE SELECTED. THE SPECIFIED 10/10 RELIABILITY AND REPELLENCE OF MULTI-VECTOR ATTACKS REQUIRE THE SIMULTANEOUS USE OF THE ENTIRE STACK (SR, GS, G-STORM INCLUDING TR AND HR).
    DISCLAIMER: USING ANY MODULE SEPARATELY OR BREAKING THE CHAIN ELIMINATES DETERMINISTIC ASSURANCE AND EXPOSES THE SYSTEM TO ERRORS. USE ONLY AS A FULL COMBINED STACK.
