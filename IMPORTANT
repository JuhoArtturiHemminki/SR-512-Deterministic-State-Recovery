INTEGRATION NOTICE: MANDATORY SEQUENTIAL ARCHITECTURE
G-STORM-512 IS AN ARCHITECTURE WHERE EVERY MODULE (SR-512, GS-512, AND G-STORM-512) IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN A SPECIFIC, IMMUTABLE SEQUENCE. THIS LINEAR PIPELINE IS A PREREQUISITE FOR DETERMINISTIC SECURITY AND 10/10 RELIABILITY.
THE SYSTEM MUST FOLLOW THIS EXACT PIPELINE SEQUENCE:

    STAGE 1: SR-512 (ALIGNMENT & PHASE-LOCK)
    ROLE: PHYSICAL ALIGNMENT. SR-512 MUST ALWAYS BE FIRST. IT ESTABLISHES THE CORRECT DATA START POINT (PHASE-LOCK) AND CORRECTS TIMING SHIFTS. WITHOUT THIS STAGE, SUBSEQUENT MODULES WILL INTERPRET DATA "OUT OF ALIGNMENT," LEADING TO SYSTEMIC HALLUCINATIONS.
    STAGE 2: GS-512 (BIT-LEVEL RECONSTRUCTION)
    ROLE: MATHEMATICAL INTEGRITY. ONCE SR-512 HAS ALIGNED THE DATA, GS-512 RECONSTRUCTS DAMAGED BITS USING GHOST-FOLD LOGIC. THIS STAGE CANNOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY BEFORE THE SR-512 ALIGNMENT PROCESS.
    STAGE 3: G-STORM-512 (RESILIENCE & DEFENSE)
    ROLE: ACTIVE PROTECTION. FINAL DATA ANALYSIS (TR) AND INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION (HR) OCCUR IN THIS STAGE. NOTE: G-STORM-512 ALSO INCORPORATES INTEGRATED INSTANCES OF SR-512 AND GS-512 WITHIN ITS ARCHITECTURE TO ENABLE REAL-TIME DIAGNOSTIC FEEDBACK AND MULTI-VECTOR DEFENSE. IT REQUIRES THE OUTPUT FROM THE PREVIOUS STANDALONE STAGES TO OPERATE WITHIN SPECIFICATION.

CRITICAL WARNING: REVERSAL RISK

    NO REVERSAL: NEVER REVERSE THE ORDER OF SR-512 AND GS-512. IF GS-512 IS EXECUTED BEFORE SR-512 ALIGNMENT, THE SYSTEM WILL GENERATE SYSTEMIC ARTIFACTS AND PERMANENT DATA CORRUPTION.
    NO HYBRID MERGING: DO NOT MERGE THESE INTO A SINGLE-CYCLE HYBRID (XSR) UNLESS DATA INTEGRITY IS SECONDARY TO RAW SPEED. THE SEPARATION AND ORDER OF MODULES ARE MANDATORY FOR DETERMINISTIC CERTAINTY.
    MANDATORY PIPELINE: BREAKING THIS SEQUENTIAL CHAIN (SR -> GS -> G-STORM) VOIDS THE 10/10 RELIABILITY SPECIFICATION AND EXPOSES THE SYSTEM TO SILENT DATA CORRUPTION (SDC) AT HIGH SPEEDS (1.6TBPS+). USE ONLY AS A FULL COMBINED STACK IN THE SPECIFIED ORDER.
